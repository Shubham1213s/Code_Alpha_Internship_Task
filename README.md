# Code Alpha Internship Project

Welcome to the Code Alpha Internship project repository! This repository contains the tasks you have completed during your internship. Each task is described below along with instructions on how to run them.

## 1. :computer: Landing Page

The Landing Page is a web page designed to introduce visitors to a product, service, or project. It provides essential information and aims to engage users and encourage them to take further action. The Landing Page you have created showcases your skills in web development and design.

To view the Landing Page:

1. :arrow_down: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. :rocket: Open the `landing_page` folder.
3. :globe_with_meridians: Launch the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## 2. :art: Background Generator

The Background Generator is a web application that allows users to generate custom background gradients using a simple user interface. Users can select different colors and adjust the gradient direction to create visually appealing backgrounds for their websites or applications.

2. :rocket: Open the `background_generator` folder.
3. :globe_with_meridians: Launch the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## 3. :file_folder: File Converter

The File Converter is a command-line tool designed to convert files between different formats. It supports various file types, such as images, documents, audio files, and more. Users can provide the input file and specify the desired output format, and the tool will handle the conversion process.

1. :arrow_down: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. :open_file_folder: Open the `file_converter` folder.
3. :keyboard: Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in your command-line interface.
4. :gear: Run the converter using the command `node converter.js [input_file] [output_format]`, replacing `[input_file]` with the path to your input file and `[output_format]` with the desired output format.
